In this project I looked at the issue of how the College Board might work to increase SAT participation.  The first step involved setting up a bar plot and evaluating the relationship between SAT and ACT participation rates.  Then I compared the SAT score for states that required the SAT against the SAT scores of all the states.  I then referenced a 2014 research report and highlighted some of the best practices identified in the report to improve SAT participation.  Finally, I looked at a heat map which measures the SAT participation rate among states.  Using this map, I suggested some areas of opportunity that the College Board can focus on to increase SAT participation.
